## Vantage Playground `1.0.0`

> The official launch of Vantage Playground.

- Website (Vantage Playground is now a website and has live updates so you don't need to download the HTML file anymore, but you can still download the source code from itch.io.)
- Improved editor and style + a start page.
- Custom objects. Change the objects width, height, friction, and density.
- FPS detection.
- Improved style.

## Vantage Playground `0.1.2`

- New style (Now with a more smoother look and an adjusted border, it's now more easier on the eyes than the previous. We changed it again because the last one still looked pretty trashy )
- Platform detector removed (This was removed because it was unnecessary and it didn't do anything really helpful.)

## Vantage Playground `0.1.1`

- Improved style (A more darker theme.)

## Vantage Playground `0.1.0`

> The first release of Vantage Playground.
